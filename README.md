I have decided to move all of my personal projects off of GitHub in response to the [incident with Julie Ann Horvath](http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/28/julie-horvath-satisfied-with-github-transparency/). After watching their handling of this and previous incidents, GitHub has lost my trust that they are an ethical company.

CEO Chris Wanstrath has [promised to do better](https://github.com/blog/1826-follow-up-to-the-investigation-results), and I sincerely hope that he follows through with his pledge.

However, trust is hard won yet easily lost. I will be following GitHub over the coming months, and if there is demonstrable change for the better in there company culture, then I will consider returning. Until then, I will be self-hosting my repos using GitLab at [https://gitlab.theoreticalideations.com/public/projects](https://gitlab.theoreticalideations.com/public/projects)

I have laid out my reasons for leaving in more detail [on my blog](https://theoreticalideations.com/2014/05/01/why-im-leaving-github/).
